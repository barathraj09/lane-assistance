# lane-assistance

The lane assistance project prevents accidents in sharp turns in hilly and mountainous regions. This solution turns the vehicle towards the track when the vehicle is found speeding near sharp turns. This is very helpful if the driver isn't aware or is too late to recognise the turn. For this miniature model I have set the distance ≤ 5 cm so that the vehicle will be turned if the distance between vehicle and sensor ≤ 5 cm

# Components Used

These are the components I used for the small scale project. more better and powerful components should be used when using in real life:

* Arduino Uno R3 is the main controller board that processes all actions
* Breadboard for splitting ports and connecting devices
* HC SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor for recognising the vehicle
* Servo Motor for turning the vehicle
* Jumper Wires
* LED lighting

# Features Expected

These are the features expected to be working and the features working are marked with the check box.

- [x] Detecting an Object
- [x] Sending and Receiving Signal
- [x] Turning of Object
- [ ] Detecting Speed of vehicle and categorisation of vehicle it is needed to be turned
- [ ] Street Lighting using LED (optional)

Any recommendations for features are welcome.

# Completeion of Model

The electronic side of things is complete, the mountainous region has to be made and fitting of the electronic components is pending. 
Expected completion by Sep 30 2021 - Oct 6 2021
